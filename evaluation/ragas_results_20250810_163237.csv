Okay, so I need to figure out how Delivery Terms and Payment Terms relate to a Purchase Order in the procurement process. Let me start by recalling what I know about procurement documents. 

I remember that a Purchase Order (PO) is a legally binding document between a buyer and a supplier. It outlines the details of the goods or services being purchased. From the context provided, the PO includes key parameters like quantities, prices, delivery schedules, and payment terms. 

Delivery Terms probably refer to when and how the goods or services will be delivered. This might include specific dates, locations, and any conditions related to shipping or receiving the items. 

Payment Terms, on the other hand, would specify how and when the supplier will be paid. This could include payment methods, due dates, and any penalties for late payments or discounts for early payments.

Looking at the Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards, I see that the PO is defined as indicating key parameters such as delivery schedule and payment terms. So, both Delivery and Payment Terms are essential components of the PO. They outline the expectations and obligations for both parties regarding the logistics and financial aspects of the transaction.

In the Procurement Manual, under section 117, the PO is described as including details like delivery dates and payment terms. It also mentions that the PO is a legally binding document upon confirmation by the supplier. This means that once the supplier accepts the PO, they are committed to delivering according to the specified terms and the buyer is committed to paying as agreed.

Additionally, the Payment Terms in the PO are crucial because they dictate the payment schedule and method. The Abu Dhabi standards emphasize that payments must be made according to the terms specified in the PO or contract. This ensures that both parties adhere to the agreed-upon financial arrangements, maintaining trust and order in the procurement process.

I should also consider how these terms are integrated into the PO creation process. The PO is created by the procurement team based on an approved Purchase Requisition. It's important that the Delivery and Payment Terms are clearly defined to avoid any misunderstandings or disputes. 

In summary, Delivery Terms and Payment Terms are integral parts of a Purchase Order. They set clear expectations for when and how deliveries will occur and how payments will be made, ensuring a smooth and legally compliant procurement process.

Okay, so I need to figure out how Delivery Terms and Payment Terms relate to a Purchase Order in the procurement process described in the provided documents. Let me start by going through each document to find relevant information.

First, looking at the Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards, I see that a Purchase Order (PO) is a legally binding document that includes key parameters like quantities, prices, delivery schedules, and payment terms. It commits both the buyer and supplier once confirmed. So, Delivery Terms would be part of the PO, specifying when and how goods or services are delivered. Similarly, Payment Terms would outline how and when payments are made.

In the Procurement Manual (Business Processes), there's a section about the PO including details like delivery schedule and payment terms. It mentions that the PO is created by Procurement and includes supplier details, descriptions, quantities, prices, and payment terms along with shipment dates. This shows that both Delivery and Payment Terms are integral parts of the PO, ensuring both parties know their obligations.

The document also talks about the importance of approved PRs being verified against existing contracts to avoid new obligations. This implies that Delivery and Payment Terms in the PO must align with any existing agreements or contracts, ensuring compliance and avoiding conflicts.

Looking at the payment process, the Procurement Manual states that payments must be made according to the terms specified in the PO or contract. This means the Payment Terms in the PO are crucial for ensuring timely and correct payments. Additionally, the PO must be approved and executed as per contractual obligations, which includes adhering to the specified Delivery and Payment Terms.

I also notice that the PO serves as an electronic trace, defining the purchase with all relevant details. This means that both Delivery and Payment Terms are recorded and can be referenced if any issues arise, providing clarity and accountability.

In summary, both Delivery and Payment Terms are essential components of a Purchase Order. They outline the expectations and obligations for both parties, ensuring that deliveries are made on time and payments are processed correctly. These terms are integral to the PO's role in the procurement process, facilitating smooth transactions and maintaining compliance with established standards and contracts.

Okay, so I need to figure out the specific sub-controls listed under ""T5.2.3 USER SECURITY CREDENTIALS MANAGEMENT"". Let me start by recalling the context provided. 

Looking through the documents, I see that T5.2.3 is mentioned in the first context snippet. It's under the section about User Security Credentials Management. The sub-controls are listed as five points. 

Wait, let me check again. The first document under context 182 lists the sub-controls as 1 through 5. Each point is a specific requirement. So, the sub-controls are about establishing a policy, secure processes, changing default credentials, storing securely, and using multi-factor authentication for critical resources.

I should make sure I'm not missing any. The other documents, like 193 and 184, talk about related topics but aren't directly under T5.2.3. So, focusing on the first document, the sub-controls are clearly outlined there.

I think that's all. So, the answer should list these five sub-controls with their descriptions, citing the correct document reference.
</think>

The specific sub-controls listed under ""T5.2.3 USER SECURITY CREDENTIALS MANAGEMENT"" are as follows:

1. **Establish a Policy**: Develop a user security credential management policy for users and administrators appropriate to the entity's purpose.
2. **Secure Processes**: Ensure the policy includes secure credential provision, revocation, and re-allocation procedures.
3. **Change Defaults**: Change default security credentials for all systems and applications upon initial use.
4. **Secure Storage**: Store credentials in a well-hashed (including salting) or encrypted format.
5. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing critical resources/assets.

These sub-controls are outlined in document T5.2.3, ensuring robust credential management practices.","<think>
Alright, I need to figure out the specific sub-controls listed under ""T5.2.3 USER SECURITY CREDENTIALS MANAGEMENT"" based on the provided context. Let me go through the documents step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. There are several documents listed, but I'm focusing on the one that mentions ""T5.2.3 USER SECURITY CREDENTIALS MANAGEMENT"". From the context, I see that this section has a CONTROL and several SUB-CONTROL points listed.

The CONTROL for T5.2.3 states that the entity shall control the allocation of user security credentials. Under this, there are five specific sub-controls:

1. Establish a user security credential management policy for users and administrators appropriate to the entity's purpose.
2. Ensure the policy includes a secure process for providing users with security credentials, including revocation and re-allocation procedures.
3. Change default security credentials for all systems and applications.
4. Store credentials securely, either hashed with salting or encrypted.
5. Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing critical resources/assets.

I should make sure these sub-controls are accurately listed and cited from the correct document. Since the user is asking specifically about T5.2.3, I need to ensure that I'm referencing the right section and not confusing it with other similar sections like T5.5.3 or T5.3.1.

I also notice that there's implementation guidance provided, but the user is asking for the specific sub-controls, so I should focus on listing those without going into the guidance unless necessary.

To present this information clearly, I'll structure it with headers and bullet points, making sure to reference the document section appropriately. I should also highlight important requirements to ensure compliance and security.

Finally, I'll double-check that all the sub-controls are included and that I'm not missing any from the provided context. This way, the response will be accurate and helpful for the user's understanding of the security credential management requirements.
